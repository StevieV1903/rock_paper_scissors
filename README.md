# [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://main.d8crcfdicg30c.amplifyapp.com/)

This is a simple responsive Rock, Paper, Scissors SPA, written in javascript, using React as the web framework. It allows a player to pick a weapon and play against the computer's weapon that is selected at random. The winner gets a point added to their score and the scores can be reset at any time on the click of a button. A cool little app to kill a few minutes boredom!!

The application is hosted on AWS Amplify

This responsive project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

### ToDo

Currently there is some additional work required around displaying the images more fluidly on render. There seems to be some delay in pulling the image through on the hosted version of the application.
